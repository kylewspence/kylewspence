# 👋 Hi, I’m Kyle

I’m a full stack developer with a background in real estate, finance, and entrepreneurship. Before diving into tech, I spent years managing multi-million-dollar portfolios, leading operations, and building systems from the ground up — experiences that now shape how I approach software: with an eye for scalability, strategy, and real-world impact.

These days, I’m passionate about building clean, intuitive apps that solve real problems — especially at the intersection of AI, data, and user experience.
